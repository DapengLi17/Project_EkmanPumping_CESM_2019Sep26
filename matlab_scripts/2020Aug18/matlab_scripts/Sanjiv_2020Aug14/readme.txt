Python:
step 1: generate grid file (POP2ROMS)
step 2: convert POP data file to ROMS-like data file.

Matlab:
step 1: run new_tracker_*.m to generate fid_*.nc files (contain cyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies center and radius)
step 2: run eddy_composite.m to do eddy composite

2020Aug17: to-do lists
read Jaison's func_init_grid.m to compute pm, pn. Include linear and nonlinear Ekman velocity computation in Sanjiv's 
eddy composite codes. Plot eddy composite Ekman pumping velocity with ssh. Maybe Include temperature contours as background for vertical heat fluxes.
