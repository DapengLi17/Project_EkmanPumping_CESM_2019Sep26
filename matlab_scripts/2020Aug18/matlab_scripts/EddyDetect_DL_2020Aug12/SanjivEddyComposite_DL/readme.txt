My version of the 'eddy_tracker' file is called new_tracker_kuro.m. The file func_write_eddy_stats is the routine which creates a netcdf file from all snapshots in all the files. There are two calls to this function, once each for cyclones and anticyclones. So, there will be two netcdf files after the execution of new_tracker_kuro.m.

The file func_init_grid.m reads in lots of grid parameters from the ROMS grid file. I have provided a symbolic link to the grid file generated by Hengkai. You will probably have to change this section for POP, hopefully if you can see how it is done for ROMS, it might give you some ideas on what changes to make for POP.
